# Rust Journey: 100 Days of Learning

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository documents my 100-day journey learning Rust programming language. As a developer with experience in Node.js, Vue, and React, I've decided to expand my skillset by diving deep into Rust, a language known for its performance, safety, and growing ecosystem.

## 🗺️ Journey Structure

The learning path is organized by topics, starting from fundamentals and progressively moving to more complex subjects. Each topic will be documented with either markdown files (for theoretical content) or `.rs` files (for code examples and exercises).

## 📂 Current Repository Structure

```bash
rust-journey/
└── fundamentals/
    └── 1-installation.md    # Day 1: Setup and installation guide
```

The structure will grow organically as I progress through my learning journey. Each new concept or practice will be added sequentially, maintaining a clear progression of topics.

## 📝 Content Types

- `.md` files: Used for theoretical content, notes, and concepts that don't require code
- `.rs` files: Used for practical examples, exercises, and actual Rust code
- Each file is prefixed with a number to maintain the learning sequence

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this 100-day journey, I aim to:

- Master Rust fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Build real-world applications using Rust
- Understand systems programming principles
- Share my learning experience with others

## 📚 Main Resources

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- Official Rust documentation
- Community tutorials and blog posts

## 📅 Progress

- [x] Day 1: Installation and Setup
- [ ] Day 2: Hello World (Coming next)
